# Penetration Testing Lab Portfolio

Welcome to my hands-on penetration testing repository. This collection of exploit walkthroughs and screenshots showcases my practical skills in identifying, exploiting, and documenting vulnerabilities using tools like:

- Kali Linux
- Metasploit
- Nmap
- Netcat
- Manual exploitation

## Included Labs

- ✅ [vsFTPd 2.3.4 Backdoor](./vsftpd-234-backdoor)
- 🔄 Samba trans2 buffer overflow (coming soon)
- 🔄 TWiki remote code execution (coming soon)

## Goal

To demonstrate real-world offensive security techniques using isolated test environments (Metasploitable2, VulnHub, TryHackMe, etc.) for portfolio, certification prep, and career advancement.
